Hi there!

My name is <span itemtype="https://schema.org/Person" itemprop="name" itemscope>Azat</span>, [I’m 33 years old](./timeline). I write frontend — mostly interfaces for web applications.

This job is a bit strange. You can spend half a day making sure a button looks right on an iPhone 6, then go home and realize you’ve spent the whole day tweaking a couple of pixels of padding. And that’s fine — it’s part of the work. But there’s something mesmerizing about it — when the code finally behaves exactly the way you envisioned.

I build [open-source projects](./projects). Sometimes you just want to make something for no money. Just because you see a problem — and you know how to fix it. You publish it online — and a week later, a pull request comes in from someone in another country. It’s a strange feeling — making something useful for strangers you’ll never meet.

In my free time, I play video games, watch [anime](./anime), and [travel](./travel-map). Escapism? Maybe. But sometimes you need to switch context — otherwise, you start thinking only in terms of components and functions.

I mostly write about tech here, but sometimes about other things too. Because programming isn’t just code.

Hello!

My name is Azat, [I am 31 years old](./timeline). I am engaged in frontend development, for me it is an opportunity to constantly grow and develop professionally. I appreciate every opportunity to work on interesting projects, solve problems and create convenient and functional interfaces.

In my free time I like to do [opensource development](./projects). It's a great way to learn new things and share my experience with others, also it allows me to keep up to date with the latest trends in development.

Below you can subscribe to my social media where I mostly write about frontend technologies.

Outside of programming my interests also include video games, [traveling](./travel-map) and learning about cultures of different countries, and [watching anime](./anime). These hobbies help me relax and get inspiration for new projects.

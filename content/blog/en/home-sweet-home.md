I've always wanted to have a personal blog where I could share my thoughts on development and what inspires me. During my work, I often have to learn new things, and I've accumulated quite a lot of notes that I would like to start publishing.

And I think it's a good idea to start the new year by creating a new blog that will be the new home for my notes.

I will maintain the blog in two languages: English and Russian. But maybe in the future, there will be translations of some articles into other languages.

This blog was developed using the new Astro framework. This thing is perfect for creating static, content-oriented websites.

The interactive components in Astro are implemented using its island architecture. In the case of this blog - all the interactive elements are written in Svelte, which is also ideal for websites where page load speed is a key concern.

If you have any ideas or thoughts on improving the site, I'd love to hear them. I'm open to feedback and any suggestions. See you soon!
